# CSCI3725

# Personal:

 This system is meaningful to me as it helps me visualize the bucket list vacations that I want go on. There are about 6 destinations that I have always wanted to visit 
 since I was a little kid, and I was able to implement them in this system. I am a pretty indecisive being, and with a very intense and busy work schedule ahead of me, this 
 machine can help me consider when, where, and how I should vacation – allowing me to have my own little “Trip Advisor” application that can help me become more decisive. 
 In addition, this will allow my inner 6-year old self visit some of the places I have always wanted to visit. 

# Challenges:

 I was challenged to understand how to setup my git once again, understand NumPy and Matplotlib, and implement real-world probabilities into a machine (considering the 
 different activities to do in other places). I was able to leverage the code I wrote with James McGowan (during the pair project) to create my own little twist that is 
 meaningful to me. In order to create a personal element to this project, I had to consider some of the places I have always wanted to visit, as well as consider what I 
 could and could not do within these domains. I was particularly challenged by the setup of transition matrices, as I had a little difficulty understanding how I could 
 create a machine that would take in one random input (taking a trip in the Winter vs taking a trip in the Summer) and ultimately decide where I should go on vacation during 
 the year. This allowed me to understand more about how Markov chains actually work, ultimately granting me a higher degree of understanding while allowing me to create a 
 machine that could be angled many different ways – ways that could benefit a whole population as opposed to just myself – giving me the ability to potentially leverage the 
 machine when creating some sort of software/algorithm for the masses. 

 I think my system is creative in a way that allows for endless possibilities of where to vacation once fully deployed (will need to leverage internet data and more options 
 in order to fully implement). In addition, my machine takes into consideration different types of variables/families of items, potentially allowing for enhanced 
 predictability which can be leveraged in differing ways (like how an interest rate cut will affect markets -> your equity portfolio, etc.).
